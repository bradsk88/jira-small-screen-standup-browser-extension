# Jira Small-Screen Stand-Up Chrome Extension

## Status
This project is in an "alpha" state. It works well for me, but your mileage may
vary.

## Purpose
A chrome extension which restructures the UI of Jira for better viewing on a small screen like a laptop

## Motivation
During my career as a software developer, I have attended thousands of "Stand-Up" 
meetings where the team huddles around someone's tiny laptop and attempts to 
remember the details of the task they are working on, which are represented on the 
screen as tiny little cards, probably with their titles truncated.

This extension is an attempt to improve that experience.

## Building this extension
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
